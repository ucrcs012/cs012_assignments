//        Requires grid file as input (input redirection).
//        Grid file looks similar to:
//
//            xxxSxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
//            x                 x
//            xxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxx
//            x                 x
//            xxxxxxxxxxxxxxGxxxx
//
//        Spaces represent empty grid blocks.  Init in EMPTY state.
//        S represents the starting grid block(s). Init in COLOR state.
//        G represents the goal grid block. More than one can exist.
//        Any non-space (x here) is considered a wall. Init in WALL state.
